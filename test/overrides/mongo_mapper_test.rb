# This file contains test cases that override devise tests, in the cases that
# the difference is values from DM versus those expected by devise is not
# particularly important and getting DM to pass the original devise tests would
# be difficult.
#
# This file contains tests shared by both data_mapper and
# data_mapper_active_model ORM setups.
# Tests specific to the data_mapper orm which uses dm-validations are in dm_validations_test.rb
# Tests specific to the data_mapper_active_model orm which uses ActiveModel
# validations would be in active_model_test.rb, but there aren't any (I would
# be rather surprised if there ever were any).
#
# For each test, an explanation is given as to why I chose to override the test,
# and the original assertion is commented above the DM-specific assertion.
